This is a forked version of [sauvegarde](https://github.com/dupgit/sauvegarde)
with slightly adjustments to the cdpfglserver being used as a submodule in [sauvegardeEX](https://github.com/LudwigEnglbrecht/sauvegardeEX).

The installation of this fork is identical to the following original readme and was successfully tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

With this project you can backup and restore files in a live and continuous
way. Compile the project and put `cdpfglserver` on the machine where you want to
save your files. Let `cdpfglclient` crawl your files to save them (on your client). 
If needed use `cdpfglrestore` to restore files or directories.

## Installation

### Dependencies

#### Mandatory

This project depends on the following projects (minimum version required is
stated between () and recommended version between []):

  * `autotools`      (2.59)
  * `glib` and `gio` (2.34)
  * `libmicrohttpd`  (0.9.5)  [0.9.46]
  * `libcurl`        (7.22.0)
  * `sqlite`         (3.7.15)
  * `jansson`        (2.5)    [2.7]
  * `zlib`           (1.2.8)

jansson's library version is quite recent but it compiles nicely and
depends on nothing (as far as I know).
Compiling cdpfgl also needs gnutls development files (used by
libmicrohttpd). Please have a look at .travis.yml file in order to see how
to compile dependencies before compiling cdpfgl.

cdpfgl's project is known to compile (sometimes at the expense of
recompiling and installing newer versions of dependencies) and run under
Centos 7, Debian Jessie, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, VoidLinux, raspbian 3 and
on x86_64 and arm7l architectures. Please let me know if you have compiled
cdpfgl successfully in a system that is not listed here.

#### Optional

  * `doxygen` (1.6.1) is used to generate code's documentation.
  * `gnuplot` (4.6) is used to generate graphs for the documentation.
  * `gource`  (0.43) is used to generate the video about project's life in
              git
  * `pandoc`  (1.12.4.2) is used to generate a .tex and then a .pdf from
              .md manual files. It is also used to generate man pages from
              .md files in 'man' directory.


If you had the code from the git repository you may generate the configure
script by invoking `./autogen.sh` script. It will execute aclocal, libtoolize
automake, autoconf, glib-gettextize and intltoolize for you. If everything
went ok you should have an executable configure script that you may use
in the classic way:

    ./configure --prefix=/my/local/install --enable-debug
    make
    make install

If you need more information about how to install cdpfgl you can
also have a look at the [installation manual](manual/installation.md).

## Usage

### The server (the one that collects everything)

First you need to run the program `cdpflgserver` on a machine that will act as
a server. You can configure options in `server.conf` (located by default
in `{prefix}/etc/cdpfgl/`) or use the command's line options as shown in
[cdpfglserver man page](man/cdpfglserver.md).

### The client (the one that saves your files).

Then you may use `cdpfglclient` program to report modified files to the server
and save them accordingly. Configuration file is named `client.conf` and
command line options are documented in [cdpfglclient man page](man/cdpfglclient.md).

### The restore program (the one that saves your life when needed)

At a time you may need to restore a file then you'll have to use `cdpfglrestore`
program. Configuration file is named `restore.conf` and command line
options are documented in [cdpfglrestore man page](man/cdpfglrestore.md).

## Manual

If you need more than the above hints, please have a look at the user
[manual](manual/installation.md).

## Roadmap

I am coding on spare hours so I may not tell any release dates and you
should consider that "It ships when its ready".

  * 0.0.12 Use compression in file_backend.
  * 0.0.13 Add some security between clients and server to avoid sending
           plain clear text messages.
  * 0.0.14 Modify file_backend to store meta data into a database
  * 0.0.15 Add a new backend that will store things into an object storage.

### Releases

  * 0.0.1  [07.08.2015] First usable version
  * 0.0.2  [08.15.2015] client redesigned
  * 0.0.3  [08.21.2015] saves and restores links
  * 0.0.4  [09.06.2015] new server url to post a bunch of hashs and
                        associated data. Clean the answer list of needed
                        hashs to avoid having duplicated hashs into it.
  * 0.0.5  [10.04.2015] fanotify's code reviewed. Avoid having one entire
                        file in memory.
  * 0.0.6  [11.02.2015] restore to some specific place. client adaptive
                        blocksize with option to choose fixed or adaptive.
                        Add options to choose CLIENT_MIN_BUFFER.
  * 0.0.7  [01.03.2016] Ability to exclude some files by extension or path.
                        Caching mechanism in client in case the server is
                        unreachable. Change GSList hash_data_list from
                        meta_data_t structure to something that allows
                        deletion of elements while walking through it.
  * 0.0.8  [04.27.2016] restore the latest version of a file before a
                        specific date. Add a new post url such as
                        (Hash_Array.json) to submit an array of hashs to
                        server that will say which hashs are needed.
                        Avoids sql injection in sqlite queries.
  * 0.0.9  [08.24.2016] New GET url in order to get a bunch of hashs and
                        their associated data to go quicker when restoring
                        files. Restore all the versions of a file. Now
                        cdpfglclient handles signals and should close its
                        database connection cleanly.
  * 0.0.10 [11.29.2016] restore a directory and it's subfiles and directories 
                        at a specific date. Write a man page for each programs.
  * 0.0.11 [09.10.2017] have some statistics with the server.
